Astronaut Kjell Lindgren captured a lightning strike from space so bright that it lights up the space station’s solar panels. He posted this on Twitter and Instagram on Sept. 2 saying "Large lightning strike on Earth lights up or solar panels.” <strong>Credits:</strong> <a href='https://images.nasa.gov/details/iss044e045215'>NASA/Kjell Lindgren</a></figcaption>

								<p>Early on in my career, I found the vast world of academia quite intimidating and somewhat confusing to navigate. Here, I have collected some resources which I had come across during my search and may be helpful to any aspiring scientists who find themselves in a similar position. Most are centered around physics research, with a special focus on opportunities available to Maltese students looking to pursue a career in astrophysics. Nonetheless, some resources might also be helpful to students interested in different areas of physics or other sciences. I will update the page accordingly as I come across any new opportunities.</p>
								<h2>Scholarships</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>The <a href='https://educationservices.gov.mt/en/education/myScholarship/Pages/TESS---Tertiary-Education-Scholarship-Scheme.aspx'>Tertiary Education Scholarship Scheme (TESS)</a> and the <a href='https://educationservices.gov.mt/en/education/myScholarship/Pages/ENDEAVOUR II.aspx'>Endeavour II Scholarship Scheme</a> are both schemes offered by the Ministry of Education (Government of Malta) which you may use to fund your Master’s Degree (MQF 7) or PhD (MQF 8) studies in Malta or abroad.</li>

									<li>Erasmus+ is an EU-funded association which organizes and offers financial support for mobility programs for students:
									<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
										<li>An <a href='https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/studying-abroad'>Erasmus exchange</a> is possible during your undergraduate degree at the University of Malta for either 1 semester or an entire scholastic year (2 years). This comes with a stipend to finance travel and living expenses, and an exemption from any tuition fees at the host university. Get in touch with your course coordinator to check in which year and destination countries this could be organized within your course program.			
										</li>
										<li><a href='https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-organisations/cooperation-among-organisations-and-institutions/erasmus-mundus-joint-masters'>Erasmus Mundus offers Joint Master Degree (EMJM)</a> programs, which are jointly designed and delivered by a group of three or more higher education institutions from at least three different countries. These are open to students from all over the world, and there is also an associated scholarship intended to cover travel, visa and living costs. Check out the <a href=https://www.eacea.ec.europa.eu/scholarships/erasmus-mundus-catalogue_en'>portal</a> to see all of the programs currently being offered.</li>
									</ul></li>

								<h2>Other Helpful Sites</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><a href='https://astrophysicsgirl.wordpress.com/astrophysics-opportunities/'>This website</a> by astrophysicsgirl Dr Hannah Dagsleigh, was and still is incredibly helpful to me during my search for opportunities, so much that it inspired me to add this section on my own website. She collected links to different opportunities in astrophysics - including summer schools, conferences, internships, as well as funded Master’s programs - conveniently organized into one place.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h2>Useful Apps</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><a href='https://www.notion.so/'>Notion</a> is a useful application which can be used to organize study materials, track finances and keep a calendar, among plenty of other functionalities. There is a free version with a page limit, but signing up using your University e-mail address will give you the <a href='https://www.notion.so/help/notion-for-education'>Plus version</a> for free.</li>
									<li><a href='https://www.zotero.org/'>Zotero</a> can be used to collect all your papers/references in one place, keep track of citations, and automatically generate bibtex files. The associated Google Chrome extension, <a href='https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc'>Zotero connector</a>, allows you to save citations directly from the web.</li>
